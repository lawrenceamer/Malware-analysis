#### levels of Abstractions 
1. Hardware (physical Level) 
2. Microcode (firmware)
3. Machine code (opcodes)
4. Low-level Language (Disassembly )
5. High-level Language (C,C++,PASCAL turned into Machine codes )
6. Interpreted Languages (Perl,C# code translated into byetcode)



#### Reverse Engineering 

take malware binary as input and generate assembly language code as output with disassembly (IDA Pro) 


#### x86 Arcgutecture 

* CPU (contains control units get execute instruction from register in RAM)
* RAM (Stack , HEAP , Code , Data)
1. Data [contains values where program is initially loaded]
2. Code [ instructions fetched by CPU to execute program tasks]
3. Heap [ dynamic memory during program execution ] 
4. Stack [ local variables , parameters to controle program flow] 

* input/output 

#### instructions 
is made of mnemonic and zero or more operand
