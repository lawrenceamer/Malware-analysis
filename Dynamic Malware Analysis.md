1.	Using Malware sandbox 
Sandbox allows malware to execute inside system environment without harming the actual system . 

GFI Sandbox 
Anubis 
ThreatExpert
Norman Sandbox 

2.	Executing DLL functions in Malware .
Rundll32.exe dll [function]\

3.	Monitoring Process Monitor 
Monitor registry , file system , network , process , thread activity 
Filemon + reg mon +procmon display 
Process Explorer(the most helpful feature is verify application depending on Digital Signature )
                              (using dependency walker by clicking on specific Process ) (Find DLL Handles )
                              (analyzing Malicious Documents by opening it as a feature )
Regshot ( to take a snap shot of registery before executing malware then compare it after running it with detailed report ) 
4.	Faking a network .
Creating fake network is helpful to get closer look about malware network indicators . 
   Tools used for this : 
1.	Apate DNS 
Spoofs DNS response to local ip using  port UDP 53(display ASCII, HEX data ) , by starting a server in Apate GUI interface will apply new DNS settings . 
2.	Net cat .  nc –l –p 80 
We can use netcat as listening server on specific port with Apate DNS to allow malware to connect back to us by dns redirection requests .
3.	Wireshark sniffing 
Wireshark is an open source packet capture tool that intercept all network traffics on specific interfaces provides in-depth analyzing ,
Filter box (filter packets ) 
Packet listing (show all packets )
Hex window (display hex content )
Follow tcp stream (conversation displayed in session order ) 
Basic Dynamic Tools in practice 
1.	Running procman and setting the filter on malware executable 
2.	Starting process explorer 
3.	Gathering First registry shot 
4.	Setting up your virtual network ApateDNS 
5.	Setting up wireshark
